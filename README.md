To achieve this analysis we have done the following:
1. Data preparation
2. EDA using visualizations and pandas and numpy
3. feature Extraction using CountVectorizer, TF-IDF and WOrd2Vec
3. Machine Learning models using Logisitic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forests, LSTM
4. Overall thoughts using word clouds
